# Baserow Formula Language Documentation

## Introduction

A Baserow Formula field lets you create a field whose contents are calculated based on a Baserow Formula you've provided. A Baserow Formula is simply some text written in a particular way such that Baserow can understand it, for example the text `1+1` is a Baserow formula which will calculate the result `2` for every row.

### Simple Formula Example

Imagine you have a table with a normal text field called `text field` with 3 rows containing the text `one`, `two` and `three` respectively. If you then create a formula field with the formula `concat('Number', field('text field'))` the resulting table would look like:

| text field | formula field |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| one        | Number one    |
| two        | Number two    |
| three      | Number three  |

### Breaking Down a Simple Formula

Let's split apart the formula `concat('Number', field('text field'))` to understand what is going on:

-   `concat`: Concat is one of many formula functions you can use. It will join together all the inputs you give to it into one single piece of text.
-   `(`: To give inputs to a formula function you first have to write an opening parenthesis indicating the inputs will follow.
-   `'Number'`: This is the first input we are giving to concat and it is literally just the text Number. When writing literal pieces of text in a formula you need to surround them with quotes.
-   `,`: As we are giving multiple inputs to concat we need to separate each input with a comma.
-   `field('text field')`: This is the second and final input we are giving to concat. We could keep on adding however many inputs as we wanted however as long as each was separated by a comma. This second input is a reference to the field in the same table with the name text field. For each cell in the formula field this reference will be replaced by whatever the value in the text field field is for that row.
-   `)`: Finally, we need to tell Baserow we've finished giving inputs to the concat function, we do this with a matching closing parenthesis.

### What is a Formula Function?

A function in a formula takes a number of inputs depending on the type of the function. It does some calculation using those inputs and produces an output. Functions also sometimes only take specific types of inputs. For example the `datetime_format` only accepts two inputs, the first must be a date (either a field reference to a date field or a sub formula which calculates a date) and the second must be some text.

All the available functions for you to use are shown in the expanded formula edit box which appears when you click on the formula whilst editing a formula field.

## Working with Different Data Types

### Using Numbers in Formulas

Formulas can be used to do numerical calculations. The standard maths operators exist like `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`. You can use whole numbers or decimal numbers directly in your formula like so: `(field('number field') + 10.005)/10`

### Using Dates

Use the `todate` function to create a constant date inside a formula like so: `todate('2020-01-01 10:20:30', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS')`. The first argument is the date you want in text form and the second is the format of the date text.

### Using Date Intervals

Subtracting two dates returns a duration representing the difference in time between the two dates: `field('date a') - field('date b')`. The `date_interval` function lets you create intervals inside the formula to work with.

Multiplying a duration and a number the result will be a duration where the number of seconds are multiplied for the number argument.

Need to calculate a new date based on a date/time interval? Use the `date_interval` function like so: `field('my date column') - date_interval('1 year')`

### Conditional Calculations

If you need to do a calculation conditionally then the `if` function and comparison operators will let you do this. For example the following formula calculates whether a date field is the first day of a month: `if(day(field('some date')) = 1, true, false)`.

You can compare fields and sub-formulas using the `>`, `>=`, `<=`, `<`, `=` and `!=` operators.

### Working with Arrays and Computed Fields

Formula functions, for example, `isblank()` or `when_empty()` work with simple values like text, number, or date fields. Computed fields like Link-to-table, look-up, and rollup fields can contain multiple items which makes them arrays or lists.

To create formulas to make a Boolean test on data in field C, taking data from field A if it's TRUE, otherwise taking data from field B if it's FALSE, you need to convert any array to text using the `join()` function. For example: `if(isblank(join(field('Organization'),'')), field('Notes'), field('Name'))`.

Using `join()` to convert the list to text handles the empty scenario correctly. This formula checks if the Organization field (a link-to-table field) has a value. If it's true, it shows the content of the Name field; otherwise, it displays the content of the Notes field.

## Hard Rules

These are the constraints most often got wrong. Breaking any of them makes the
formula fail to compile.

1. **Reference every field with `field('Name')`.** Curly-brace references
   borrowed from other tools are not part of this language and cannot even be
   tokenized, so the parser rejects them before any type checking happens.
   Write `field('Total')`, never a brace-wrapped field name.
2. **`and()` and `or()` take exactly 2 arguments.** For three or more conditions,
   nest them: `or(a, or(b, c))`, `and(a, and(b, c))`. Passing 3+ arguments fails
   with "N arguments were given to the 'or' function".
3. **`min()` and `max()` take a single array argument**, such as a `lookup()` or a
   link/lookup `field()`. They are not two-argument scalar functions. For the
   larger of two values use `if(a > b, a, b)`.
4. **`datetime_format()` format strings are PostgreSQL `to_char` patterns**, not
   moment.js or Excel patterns. Use `'Day'` (or `'FMDay'` unpadded) for a weekday
   name, `'Month'` for a month name, `'YYYY-MM-DD'` for a date, `'HH24:MI'` for a
   24-hour time. Lowercase moment tokens such as `'dddd'`, `'mmmm'` or `'hh:mm'`
   are silently wrong and produce numbers rather than names.
5. **Only use functions listed in the Function Reference below.** Baserow is not
   Excel: `weekday`, `substitute`, `countif`, `iferror`, `datedif` and `sumif` do
   not exist. Their nearest equivalents here are `todate`/`datetime_format`,
   `replace`/`regex_replace`, `sum(filter(...))`, `when_empty` and `date_diff`.

## Type Coercion

Most functions accept only certain argument types. When the value you have is not the
type a function wants, convert it: a type mismatch is a reason to add a conversion, never
a reason to conclude that something cannot be expressed. The error names the argument
position and the type it received, and lists the accepted types when there are any.

| You have | You want | Use | Notes |
| -------- | -------- | --- | ----- |
| any valid type | text | `totext(x)` | `totext` accepts every valid type, including single select, multiple select, multiple collaborators, link row, lookup, date, number and boolean. |
| single select | text | `totext(field('x'))` | Returns the selected option's value, or `''` when the cell is empty. |
| multiple select / multiple collaborators | text | `totext(field('x'))` | Returns the values joined into one string. The same holds for a `lookup()` of such a field. |
| a list (link row, lookup, array) | text | `join(field('x'), ', ')` | `join` takes a list plus a separator. If the items are not text, convert them first: `join(totext(field('x')), ', ')`. |
| text | number | `tonumber(x)` | `tonumber` accepts text only; wrap anything else: `tonumber(totext(field('x')))`. |
| any value | a non-empty value | `when_empty(x, fallback)` | Both arguments must be the same type. |
| a list (link row, lookup, multiple select) | item count | `count(field('x'))` | |
| multiple select | test for an option | `has_option(field('x'), 'value')` | |

`concat(...)` applies `totext` to every argument itself, so mixing types inside it needs
no wrapping.

`=` and `!=` cast both sides to text when the two types differ but are comparable, so a
single select can be compared with text directly. A multiple select is comparable only
with another multiple select: test its contents with `has_option`, or compare
`totext(field('x'))`. The ordering operators `>`, `>=`, `<` and `<=` refuse select fields
in either position.

### Date and Time Functions

Build more powerful formulas around dates in Baserow. The `today()` and `now()` functions update every 10 minutes.

The `today()` function is useful for calculating intervals or when you need to have the current date displayed on a table. The `now()` function is useful when you need to display the current date and time on your table or calculate a value based on the current date and time, and have that value updated each time you open your database.

### Aggregate Functions

These functions collapse a **list** of values into one value. A list only ever comes
from a reference to a link row field, a reference to a lookup field, or a `lookup()`
call. A plain field of the current row holds a single value and can never be
aggregated — combine values within one row with the arithmetic operators, and use an
aggregate function only to combine values across linked rows.

A `field()` reference to a link row field carries the **type of the linked table's
primary field**, as a list; `lookup()` carries the type of the field it names. Arguments
are type checked and never coerced, so that type must already be one the function
accepts: `sum` and `avg` take numbers or durations; `min` and `max` also take text and
dates; `every` and `any` take booleans; `join` takes a lookup field reference or a list
of text; `count` takes a list of any type, and also a multiple select or multiple
collaborators field directly.

When a list is not yet the type a function needs, convert it rather than concluding the
conversion is unsupported. `totext()` accepts every valid type, including multiple
select and multiple collaborators, so `join(totext(field('a link row field')), ', ')` is
the general way to render any list as text.
