    Raised when an application user isn't allowed to sign in because the workspace (or
    instance) has reached its application user limit.

    It is a self-describing ``APIException`` so that the plain REST login endpoint
    (``UserSourceObtainJSONWebToken`` in core) renders it directly without needing a
    core-side exception mapping. The enterprise SSO views map it to an
    ``SsoErrorCode`` instead, so the base class is irrelevant there.
