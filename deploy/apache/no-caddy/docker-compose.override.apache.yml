# This compose file is for testing our example Apache configuration locally specifically
# with the `docker-compose.no-caddy.yml` file in the root of the repo.

# To test this setup you can run:
# ```
# cp .env.testing .env
# docker-compose -f ../../../docker-compose.no-caddy.yml -f docker-compose.override.apache.yml up
# ```


# To test you have to add `127.0.0.1 example.localhost` to your /etc/hosts.
