# Realtime Presence

This document defines the **language and conceptual model** of Baserow's presence feature.

Presence is built on Baserow's WebSocket infrastructure; see [websockets.md](websockets.md) for connection lifecycle, reconnection, and event durability. This document reuses its terms (web socket ID, page subscriptions, channel groups) without re-defining them. Presence events are ephemeral and bypass the PostgreSQL replay log.

Presence answers one question for people working in the same place: **who else is here, and what are they doing?** — bounded by what each viewer is permitted to see.

> **Presence is best-effort and partial by design.** It reflects only what is observable over live connections: who is connected and looking, and their focus. Mutations that arrive through other paths — imports, API calls, data sync, server jobs — have no connection and no focus, and never appear. Presence is descriptive ("who we know is here right now"); it is **never an activity feed, an audit log, or a security/completeness guarantee**. An empty presence space does not mean nobody touched the data.

## Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Presence** | The feature: who is present on a shared place and what they're doing, bounded by each viewer's permissions. Best-effort and partial — not an activity/audit/security record. |
| **Connection** | One WebSocket connection, identified by a `web_socket_id` at the transport layer. A single user may have several (multiple tabs). |
| **Member** | A connection's representation within a presence space, identified by a `presence_id` (an opaque UUID generated per connection, separate from `web_socket_id`). `presence_id` is the key in Redis, in WS payloads, and in the frontend store. `web_socket_id` is never exposed in presence payloads — it stays in the transport layer for routing and self-echo suppression. |
| **User presence** | The user-visible roll-up: "User X is here," derived by collapsing a space's members by `user_id`. An avatar bar is one way to surface it. |
| **Presence space** | The single logical location presence is tracked for — e.g. one table's grid, whose presence space is `table-42` (Redis key `presence:table-42`, channel group `presence.table-42`). Every connection viewing that location shares one space, **independent of how many data channel groups back it**. One space per location; a presence concept, distinct from any single channel group. |
| **Presence visibility** | The per-recipient decision "should this recipient see that a connection is present *at all*?" Evaluated — depends on how both the observer and the observed entered the space, not a static flag on the connection. |
| **Presence focus** | What one connection is doing within a space — a typed value (e.g. a selected cell) or nothing. Each connection has at most one current focus **per space**; only the latest matters (it is a current state, not a history). |
| **Focus visibility** | The per-recipient decision "should this recipient see this focus?", answered by the recipient's host — the page they entered through — and denied unless that host grants it. Lets one space serve viewers with different permissions without leaking what a viewer may not see. |
| **Presence focus type** | A registered kind of focus (e.g. `cell`, `row`) that owns only its payload shape — validating and normalising what clients send. Pluggable; not owned by any one page type. Whether a recipient sees a focus is focus visibility, owned by the recipient's host, not by the focus type. |
| **Presence focus staleness** | A focus state no longer trustworthy. Reserved for future client-side enforcement per focus type. Not currently implemented — an `editing: true` indicator persists until an explicit clear (disconnect, navigation, or editing end). |

### Entity relationships

| Relationship | Cardinality | Example |
|---|---|---|
| User → Connections | 1:N | 3 browser tabs = 3 connections |
| Connection → Presence spaces | 1:N | One tab on a table grid and an expanded-row modal |
| Presence space → Members | N:M | A space has 5 members from 3 users |
| Member → Presence focus (per space) | 1:1 | A tab's grid focus and modal focus are independent; within a space only the latest focus is kept |

### Example: one space, many channel groups

Bram (full access) and Davide (a restricted view) both open table 42:

- **Bram** subscribes via the `table` page; his connection belongs to the channel group `table-42`. He is looking at rows 1–100.
- **Davide** cannot listen to the whole table, so he subscribes via the `restricted_view` page; his connection belongs to a *different* channel group, `restricted-view-7`. His view exposes only rows 50–75, and that is what he is looking at.

> **V1 note:** In the initial release, restricted views are **excluded** from presence entirely — `RestrictedViewPageType.get_presence_space_name` returns `None`. This avoids leaking full-access user IDs to restricted view users before a proper asymmetric visibility gate is in place. The example below describes the **target model** for a future version.

Conceptually, they are on different channel groups but interact in the **same presence space**, `table-42`. So, where visibility allows, they see each other:

- Whether Davide sees Bram's avatar at all depends on **presence visibility** — because Davide entered via a restricted view, the visibility rule might hide full-access users from him. Bram, with full access, always sees Davide.
- They see each other's **focus** on rows they can both see (rows 50–75) — **focus visibility**.
- If Bram selects a cell on row 30, Davide does **not** see it: row 30 is outside what Davide may see, so focus visibility withholds it — even though both are in the same space.

## The conceptual model

### One space per place

A presence space is a logical location, not a transport channel. The same place (e.g. a table) is delivered to different users over different per-permission channel groups; presence collapses all of them into **one** space so that everyone viewing that place can see each other. A host (today a page type) opts in to presence and declares which logical place each subscription belongs to; permission-tiered entry points for the same place resolve to the same space. Presence is not tied to tables — any place a host enables it for (a grid, a dashboard, a builder page, …) is a presence space; table 42 is just the running example.

### Joining and leaving

A connection becomes present when it subscribes to a presence-enabled place, and is removed when it unsubscribes or disconnects. A connection can be present in several spaces at once (e.g. a grid and an expanded-row modal), each tracked independently; a disconnect clears all of them.

Cleanup primarily uses the **disconnect signal**. Server-side WebSocket keepalives
detect unresponsive clients; an idle browser that still answers keepalives remains
connected and present. A worker crash can prevent disconnect cleanup from running.
The Redis presence hash has a coarse 12-hour expiry for the whole space, refreshed
by member activity. It is not an individual member's liveness deadline: activity
can keep abandoned entries in a busy space. A focus update rewrites the member's
full entry atomically, recreating it if the space expired. Presence remains
best-effort, so neither completeness nor permanent membership is guaranteed.

### Two-axis visibility

Two independent, per-recipient questions decide what a viewer sees. They compose — a connection must be presence-visible before its focus can be seen at all:

| Axis | Question | Owner | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Presence visibility** | May this viewer see that a connection is present at all? | The place's host | Visible |
| **Focus visibility** | Given the connection is visible, may this viewer see its focus? | The place's host (the recipient's entry point) | Hidden — fail-closed; focus delivery is opt-in per host |

**Presence visibility** is evaluated per recipient — the host determines who sees whom based on how each entered the space. A full-access viewer may see everyone; a restricted viewer may see only others at the same access level. The rule is **asymmetric by design**: who you see depends on your entry point, not theirs.

**Focus visibility** is answered by the *recipient's* entry point: the host they subscribed through decides, per event, whether they may see it. The default denies — a host that enables presence must explicitly grant focus delivery, and any error while deciding also withholds the focus (fail closed). This is how one shared space safely serves viewers with different permissions: a viewer sees focus only on the rows and fields they are permitted to see.

Focus visibility is all-or-nothing: a viewer sees a connection's focus in full, or not at all. It never affects presence visibility — in the members snapshot a withheld focus is nulled out while the member stays listed. The same per-recipient rule runs on live focus broadcasts and on the stored focus delivered in the members snapshot on subscribe.

### Focus

Focus is what a connection is doing within a space — a single current value per space, replaced on each change, with no history.

Before a focus is shown, three questions are answered, in order:

1. **Is presence enabled here?** — a property of the place.
2. **Is the focus well-formed?** — unknown or invalid focus is silently dropped.
3. **May this recipient see it?** — focus visibility, answered per recipient by their host.

> An *applicability* check — "does this kind of place support this kind of focus?" (a grid has cells and rows; a dashboard has neither) — is a deliberate future seam that is **not implemented**: today any registered focus kind is accepted on any presence-enabled place.

**Emitting and seeing are separate.** Emitting is unrestricted — any member of a presence-enabled space may store any well-formed focus. Seeing is decided per recipient at delivery time by the host the recipient entered through. Two users on the same grid emit cell focus identically; what each *sees* depends only on their own entry point.

**Staleness** is reserved for future implementation. Currently, an `editing: true` indicator persists until an explicit clear (the user stops editing, navigates away, or disconnects). A client-side staleness timer may be added later if phantom editing indicators become a problem in practice.

## Membership

Presence uses **one** space per place and enforces visibility *within* it, per recipient — rather than relying on the permission-tiered split of the data channels. A connection is in a space only because it was already allowed to subscribe to a page that maps there — presence adds no separate permission gate.

---

## Presentation behavior

- **Avatars show unique users**, not connections — multiple tabs of one person collapse to a single avatar, with a deterministic per-user colour. When more users are present than fit, the rest collapse into a counter.
- **A user does not see their own focus** as a presence indicator — the native selection UI already shows it. Their own avatar is **not** shown in the presence bar — only other users appear.
- **Focus highlights** show another user's selected cell or row (with their colour and full name), and an editing indicator when they are actively editing. Highlights render only for what is currently on screen.
- **Focus emission is debounced per space.** Navigation focus (cell/row selection changes) is debounced at 150ms — others see where you land, not each step. Editing state transitions (start/stop editing) send immediately, without debounce. When a user is alone in a space, focus sends are skipped — except **clears**: once a focus has actually been transmitted, its clear always goes out, so the server never holds stale focus that a later joiner would receive. When another member joins, the sender re-emits its current focus so the joiner sees it without waiting for the next change.
- **When several users focus the same target**, one label is shown — an actively editing user wins — plus a counter for the rest.

## Runtime and scaling

Presence membership and current focus live in Redis; their broadcasts go directly
through the channel layer. They have no replay event IDs and are not retained or
replayed with database changes. Reconnection rebuilds presence through subscriptions
and member snapshots. Disabling replay recording does not disable presence.

Presence uses async Redis calls. Database-backed presence-space resolution, such
as a public-view lookup, uses the measured ORM adapter described in
[WebSocket concurrency](websockets.md#concurrency-and-database-access). Current focus
validation and recipient filtering are small, database-free functions; keep this
frequent delivery path nonblocking.

Snapshot reads and decoding grow with a space's membership. Broadcast processing
grows with its channel recipients, even when some consumers subsequently discard
the payload. A UI avatar limit does not cap either cost. Preserve recipient
visibility, visitor counts, and `presence.editors_active` signaling when changing
fanout. Use [queue and event-loop metrics](../installation/monitoring.md#websocket-and-realtime-metrics)
to separate shared-thread waits from Redis work and CPU pressure.

## Future capabilities (permitted, not built)

The model deliberately *reserves room for* these without building them now; each can be added without changing the concepts or the wire-level contract:

- **Filtered focus on restricted views** — showing a viewer only the focus on rows/fields they may see. The host's per-recipient focus rule is the reserved seam, already applied to live broadcasts and the members snapshot alike; today the only presence-enabled host (the table page) grants everything, because its subscribers have full table visibility anyway.
- **Entry-point-aware presence visibility** — visibility rules that depend on how each party entered the space (e.g. restricted viewers not seeing full-access users, admins seeing anonymous public-view users). The evaluated presence-visibility model is the reserved seam. In V1, restricted views are excluded from presence entirely; in V2 they will join with asymmetric visibility (full-access sees restricted users, not vice versa).
- **Stronger cleanup of abandoned entries** — a backstop for the rare case where a disconnect signal is lost. Disconnect remains the primary mechanism either way.
