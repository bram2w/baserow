The table below shows all available environment variables supported by Baserow. 
Some environment variables have different defaults, are not supported, are optional etc
depending on how you installed Baserow. See the specific installation guides for how 
to set these environment variables.

## Environment Variables

The installation methods referred to in the variable descriptions are:

* [The Standalone service images](install-using-standalone-images.md)
* [The baserow/baserow "all in one" image](install-with-docker.md)
* [The Docker compose install](install-with-docker-compose.md)

> Variables marked with *Internal* should only be changed if you know what you are 
> doing.

| BASEROW\_EXTRA\_ALLOWED\_HOSTS       | An optional comma separated list of hostnames which will be added to the Baserow's Django backend [ALLOWED_HOSTS](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts) setting. In most situations you will not need to set this as the hostnames from BASEROW\_PUBLIC\_URL or PUBLIC\_BACKEND\_URL will be added to the ALLOWED_HOSTS automatically. This is only needed if you need to allow additional different hosts to be able to access your Baserow.                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                               | 
| PRIVATE\_BACKEND\_URL                | **Only change this with standalone images.** This is the URL used when the web-frontend server directly queries the backend itself when doing server side rendering. As such not only the browser, but also<br>the web-frontend server should be able to make HTTP requests to the backend. The web-frontend nuxt server might not have access to the \`PUBLIC\_BACKEND\_URL\` or there could be a more direct route, (e.g. from container to container instead of via the internet). For example if the web-frontend and backend were containers on the same docker network this could be set to http://backend:8000. |                                                                                               |
| BASEROW\_CADDY\_GLOBAL\_CONF         | **Not supported by standalone images.** Will be substituted into the Caddyfiles global config section.

| BASEROW\_TRIGGER\_SYNC\_TEMPLATES\_AFTER\_MIGRATION | If set to “true” when after a migration Baserow will automatically sync all builtin Baserow templates in the background. If you are using a postgres database which is constrained to fewer than 10000 rows then we recommend you disable this as the Baserow templates will go over that row limit.

| DONT\_UPDATE\_FORMULAS\_AFTER\_MIGRATION            | Baserow’s formulas have an internal version number.

Set this to any non empty value to disable this automatic update if you would prefer to run the update\_formulas management command manually yourself. Formulas might break if you forget to do so after an upgrade of Baserow until and so it is recommended to leave this empty. |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Do not include any schema like `http://`, `https://` as regexes will only be run against the hostname/IP of the user configured URL. For example set this to `^(?!(www\.)?allowedhost\.com).*` to block all hostnames and IPs other than `allowedhost.com` or `www.allowedhost.com`.                                       |            |
| BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_IP\_WHITELIST                       | **Disabled if BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_ALLOW\_PRIVATE\_ADDRESS is set.** List of comma seperated IP addresses or ranges that webhooks will be **allowed** to use after the webhook URL has been resolved to an IP using DNS. Only checked if the URL passes the BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_URL\_REGEX\_BLACKLIST. Takes precedence over BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_IP\_BLACKLIST meaning that a whitelisted IP will always be let through regardless of the ranges in BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_IP\_BLACKLIST. So use BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_IP\_WHITELIST to punch holes the ranges in BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_IP\_BLACKLIST, and not the other way around. Accepts a string in the format: "127.0.0.1/32,192.168.1.1/32" |            |
| BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_IP\_BLACKLIST                       | **Disabled if BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_ALLOW\_PRIVATE\_ADDRESS is set.** List of comma seperated IP addresses or ranges that webhooks will be **denied** from using after the URL has been resolved to an IP using DNS. Only checked if the URL passes the BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_URL\_REGEX\_BLACKLIST. BASEROW\_WEBHOOKS\_IP\_WHITELIST supersedes any ranges specified in this variable. Accepts a string in the format: "127.0.0.1/32,192.168.1.1/32"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |            |
