# Grid View Test Plan

Browser coverage for the grid view lives in `e2e-tests/tests/database/grid/`.

This plan defines the expected visible behavior and maps it to e2e coverage,
organized by numbering rules, a coverage matrix, and scenario expectations.

Expected sequences are intentionally repetitive. Use the same sentence for the
same visible side effect whenever a test is added or changed.

`TODO` marks an expected visible detail that the current e2e tests do not
verify. Keep those details in the plan so future tests know the intended
behavior.

## Numbering Convention

Test IDs use `bucket.group.scenario` plus an optional letter suffix for closely
related variants, for example `1.2.1b`.

The first number identifies the domain:

| Bucket | Domain                              |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 1      | Row creation                        |
| 2      | Row updates                         |
| 3      | Row deletion                        |
| 4      | Clipboard and multi-cell edits      |
| 5      | Filters                             |
| 6      | Sorts                               |
| 7      | Group-by                            |
| 8      | Search                              |
| 9      | View display options                |
| 10     | Cell selection                      |
| 11     | Keyboard navigation                 |
| 12     | Row hover and context menus         |
| 13     | Checkbox selection and bulk actions |
| 14     | Row expand modal                    |
| 15     | Public shared grid                  |
| 16     | Realtime row events                 |
| 17     | Realtime metadata and presence      |
| 18     | Data-sync read-only mode            |
| 19     | Row ordering                        |

Within each bucket, groups start at `.1` and increase by topic. In covered
create, update, and clipboard sections, `.2` is filter-affecting behavior and
`.3` is sort-affecting behavior. Group-by has its own bucket (7) for standalone
behavior (collapse/expand, refresh); its create, update, and paste interactions
live in the operation buckets (e.g. 1.5, 2.2.7, 2.4, 4.7), the same way filters
and sorts do. Specs may group setup-heavy blocks out of numeric order when that
keeps related fixtures together. Letter suffixes (`a`, `b`, `c`) are timing or
selection variants of the same scenario.

## Coverage Matrix

Maps `operation × active constraints × timing` to the test section that covers
it. `TODO` = uncovered. `—` = not applicable.

**Optimistic (✓):** every active constraint is on a regular field the frontend
can evaluate locally — warnings appear immediately and the row moves or hides
without waiting for the backend.

**Deferred (✗):** at least one active constraint involves a formula field the
frontend cannot evaluate — warnings and row changes for that constraint are
deferred until the backend responds. Pressing Escape key before the backend
responds is `—` because no warning has appeared yet for the deferred constraint.

**Backend error column:** the backend returns a 5xx error. The optimistic value
(always applied immediately for field edits) must be rolled back. For optimistic
constraints the warning also disappears on rollback; for deferred constraints no
warning appeared so only the value rollback matters. Error toasts are asserted
for covered row CRUD backend-error cases.

When multiple constraints are active and only some involve formula fields, the
row can show an immediate warning for the optimistic constraints while still
waiting on the deferred ones. The "Constraint fields" column records which
constraint fields are regular vs. formula; for combined rows "all regular" and
"any formula" are used since every combined cell is TODO and the specific
field-type breakdown belongs in the scenario description when the test is
written.

| Operation | Constraint | Constraint field | Optimistic | Keep selected                                                                                  | Deselect after confirm                                                                         | Deselect before confirm                                                                           | Backend error                                                                | Escape                                                     |

Regular-field filter/sort create/update cases and saved filter/sort load cases
are parametrized to run in both flat and expanded group-by views. Dedicated
group-by rows above cover creating inside a group and changing a grouped value.

### Combined constraints (TODO)

Most combinations of two or more active constraints (filter + sort, filter +
group-by, sort + group-by, filter + sort + group-by) still need deeper coverage.
Covered group-by combinations are regular-field filter/sort create/update and
saved filter/sort load via parametrized flat/group-by runs, plus
[2.2.6a](#226a-edit-filtered-grouped-row-to-non-matching-value).
Remaining combinations should be tested in both the all-regular (fully
optimistic) and any-formula (deferred) configurations.

### 4.3.1a Sort-affecting paste shows Row has moved warning then moves row on deselect

- Pasted value is visible immediately.
- "Row has moved" is visible immediately for simple-field sorts.
- Row stays in its current visible position while selected.
- After deselect, the row moves to its sorted position.
- After deselect, "Row has moved" is hidden.

### 4.3.1b Sort-affecting paste deselected before backend confirmation moves row immediately

- Pasted value is visible immediately.
- "Row has moved" is visible immediately for simple-field sorts.
- After deselect while the update request is pending, the row moves to its sorted
  position.
- After deselect, "Row has moved" is hidden.
- Row stays in its sorted position after backend confirmation.
- No warning is visible after backend confirmation.

### 4.7.1a Group-by-affecting paste kept selected then deselected

- Pasted group-by value is visible immediately with a "Row has moved" warning.
- Row remains in its original group while selected.
- After deselect, the row moves to the target group.
- Source and target group counters update locally.

### 4.7.1b Group-by-affecting paste deselected before backend confirmation

- Pasted group-by value is visible immediately with a "Row has moved" warning.
- Deselecting before confirmation moves the row to its new group immediately.
- Source and target group counters update locally.
- The move stays stable after the backend confirms.

### 4.4.1 Delete clears selected cell range

- Rectangular multi-select range is visible.
- Pressing Delete clears every selected cell value.
- Non-selected cells are unchanged.

## Filters

These saved filter cases run in both flat and expanded group-by views.

### 5.1.1 Load view with API-created filter

- Grid opens with only matching rows visible.
- Non-matching rows are absent from the visible grid.

### 5.1.2 Load view with two AND filters

- Grid opens with only rows matching both filters visible.
- Rows matching only one condition are absent from the visible grid.

### 5.2.1 Use text contains filter

- Grid opens with every row containing the substring visible.
- Non-matching rows are absent from the visible grid.

## Sorts

These saved sort cases run in both flat and expanded group-by views.

### 6.1.1 Sort ASC

- Grid opens with rows visible in ascending order.

### 6.1.2 Sort DESC

- Grid opens with rows visible in descending order.

### 6.1.3 Sort by Name ASC and Score DESC

- Grid opens with primary sort applied first.
- Rows tied on Name are ordered by Score descending.

## Group-by

Standalone group-by behavior. Group-by also appears as a constraint within the
operation buckets — create in a group (1.5.x), changing a group-by value (2.2.7,
2.4.x), and group-by-affecting paste (4.7.x) — plus the parametrized
flat/group-by runs, the same way filters and sorts do.

### 7.1.1 Grouped views load expanded and collapse or expand all groups

- Grouped views initially render group banners expanded with their rows visible.
- Collapsing all groups hides every group's rows and leaves the banners visible.
- Expanding all groups restores the rows in their groups and keeps group counters.
- Rows fetched on the initial expanded load stay in the store while collapsed, so
  re-expanding does not refetch them.

### 7.1.2 Collapse and expand a group

- Collapsing one group hides only that group's rows.
- Other expanded groups stay visible.
- Expanding the group restores its rows in place.

### 7.2.1 Adding a group-by refreshes with one metadata request and one row request

- A view already grouped by one field renders its group banners with counters.
- Adding a second group-by field issues exactly one group-by-data metadata
  request and exactly one grid rows request, not a request per group.
- The group-by-data request includes `include_descendants=true`.
- New nested group banners and their counters are visible after the refresh.
- Total row count is unchanged.

### 7.3.1 Group headers show per-column aggregation summaries

- When a column has a "Summarize" aggregation configured, each group header shows
  that column's aggregation computed over that group's rows, column-aligned under
  the field, at every group-by depth.
- The summary is visible whether the group is collapsed or expanded.
- It respects the view's filters and search, the same scope as the group row count.
- A column set to the `distribution` aggregation shows no value in group headers;
  its bottom-footer value is unaffected.
- The bottom footer still shows the overall total for the column.

### 7.3.2 Hovering a group header to pick or change an aggregation

- Hovering a group-by header reveals, per column, the aggregation value or a
  `+ Summarize` affordance on the hovered column (only the hovered column).
- Clicking it opens the aggregation menu; choosing a function sets it for the
  column, so the bottom footer and every group's header show that function
  together (shared column setting).
- After choosing a function, the affected values show a brief loading spinner and
  update in place. The group layout (rows, counts, offsets) is not rebuilt; only
  the aggregation values change.

### 7.3.3 Live group aggregation updates on row changes

- Editing a cell updates that row's group value (and its ancestor groups + the
  footer total) in place, with no spinner — like a spreadsheet SUM.
- Moving a row between groups (editing a group-by field) updates both the source
  and destination group values.
- A second browser session viewing the same grouped view sees the values update
  via realtime, the same way.
- Changing the sort does not change aggregation values (they are order-independent),
  so no aggregation request is made for a sort change.
- In grouped mode the values come from a single `group-by-data` request (the
  standalone `/aggregations/` footer endpoint is not called).

## Search

### 8.1.1 Search in highlight mode

- Search panel is open.
- Search is idle.
- Matching cells are highlighted.
- Non-matching rows remain visible.
- Non-matching cells are not highlighted.

### 8.1.2 Search with no matches in highlight mode

- Search panel is open.
- Search is idle.
- No cells are highlighted.
- All rows remain visible.

### 8.1.3 Clear search

- Existing highlights are hidden.
- All rows remain visible.

### 8.1.4 Search matches a non-primary field

- Matching non-primary cell is highlighted.
- Primary plus non-primary multi-field highlight in the same row is TODO.

### 8.2.1 Search in hide-not-matching mode

- Typing search hides non-matching rows.
- Matching rows remain visible.

### 8.2.2 Toggle hide-not-matching mode off

- Hidden rows become visible again.
- Matching cells remain highlighted.

## View Display Options

### 9.1.1 Row coloring from single-select color

- Grid opens with all rows loaded.
- Selected single-select values are visible.
- Row background uses the selected option color in the frozen-left section.
- Row background uses the selected option color in the scrollable-right section.
- The row surface on top of the color wrapper stays transparent, so the
  decoration color is actually painted.
- No row loading spinner is shown because row coloring is loaded from the saved
  view decoration.

### 9.1.2 Row coloring with group-by

- Grid opens with the saved group-by applied.
- Group banners show each group value with its row count.
- Row background uses the selected option color in the frozen-left section.
- Row background uses the selected option color in the scrollable-right section.
- The row surface on top of the color wrapper stays transparent, so the
  decoration color is actually painted (grouped rows previously painted an
  opaque background over it).
- No row loading spinner is shown because row coloring is loaded from the saved
  view decoration.

### 9.2.1 Hide and show a non-primary field

- Field header is initially visible.
- Field cells are initially visible.
- Hiding the field removes the field header immediately.
- Hiding the field removes the field cells immediately.
- Hidden state persists after reload.
- Row count is unchanged.
- Showing the field restores the field header.
- Showing the field restores the field cells with their values.
- Shown state persists after reload.

### 9.3.1 Change row height

- Grid opens at small row height.
- Values are visible.
- Selecting Medium changes visible rows to 55px.
- Values remain visible after changing row height.
- Selecting Large changes visible rows to 99px.
- Values remain visible after changing row height.
- Large row height persists after reload.
- No row loading spinner is shown.

### 9.4.1 Load view with frozen columns

- Saved frozen column count moves the first non-primary field into the frozen-left
  section.
- Frozen field header is absent from the scrollable-right section.
- Next non-primary field remains visible in the scrollable-right section.
- Frozen column layout persists after reload.

### 9.5.1 Count mode shows sequential row positions

- Row count column shows "1" for the first row, "2" for the second, and so on.
- Note: the backend default for a new view is `row_identifier_type = "id"`. Tests
  that verify count mode must explicitly set the view to count mode via API before
  navigating.

### 9.5.2 Switch to Row identifier and back to Count

- Clicking the dropdown icon in the row count header opens the identifier picker.
- Selecting "Row identifier" changes the count column to show actual backend row IDs.
- Sequential position values are no longer visible.
- Row identifier values persist after reload.
- Selecting "Count" restores sequential position values.
- Row identifier values are no longer visible.
- Count values persist after reload.

### 9.6.1 Switch to Columns replaces banners with spanning group cells

- Grouped by Team with three rows in two groups.
- Choosing "Columns" in the group-by menu sends one view PATCH with
  `group_by_layout: "column"`.
- No `.grid-view__group-by-banner` remains; each group renders one
  `.grid-view__group-span` in the frozen section whose `.grid-view__group-count`
  shows the group's row count; all rows stay visible and ordered.
- The layout survives a reload.

### 9.6.2 Second level adds a column; Banners restores the banners

- Adding a second group-by in column layout renders two
  `.grid-view__head-group` header cells and a span for the nested group.
- Choosing "Banners" sends one view PATCH, restores the banners and removes every
  span.

### 9.6.3 Five Columns groups keep the data pane usable at a narrow viewport

- A view grouped by the maximum five fields opens in Columns at a 1024px browser
  viewport.
- All five group headers and spans remain visible, while their display widths are
  proportionally fitted without going below the minimum column width.
- The right data pane remains 300px wide, contains the primary value, and exposes
  its horizontal scrollbar.
- Group headers and body spans remain aligned, and resize handles are withheld
  while responsive fitting is active so a drag cannot persist a misleading width.
- Widening the viewport restores every configured 200px group width without a
  persistence mutation and restores the resize handles.

### 9.6.4 Column width resize persists

- At a wide viewport, dragging the group-column resize handle by 40px sends one
  group-by PATCH containing `width: 240`.
- The header and every matching body span move from 200px to 240px together.
- The 240px width survives a reload.

### 9.6.5 Row drag uses the Columns offset and persists

- Dragging a row within a group renders the drag overlay after the 200px group
  column and exposes a valid drop target.
- The move request targets the expected `before_id` and view.
- The new row order and group count survive a reload.

### 9.6.6 Columns virtualizes thousands of uneven rows and groups

- The fixture contains 3,000 rows grouped into 50 parent groups and 1,500 nested
  leaf groups. Leaf groups alternate between one and three rows, while parents
  alternate between 29 and 31 leaves, forcing sparse page estimates to converge
  across uneven boundaries.
- Switching from collapsed Banners to Columns expands the rendered hierarchy
  without overwriting the saved Banner collapse state.
- Deep wheel jumps across singleton/large leaf, parent, sparse-page and midpoint
  boundaries render exact absolute count identifiers and matching parent/leaf
  spans.
- The first parent span keeps its exact 57-row height and sticky label at a deep
  offset.
- Fewer than 100 left rows, right rows and spans are mounted at both the start and
  end. Attempted group and row data requests remain independently below 200 and
  below 250 combined.
- Switching back to Banners restores the collapsed state; switching to Columns
  again and reloading preserves the Columns layout, hydrates the first row, and
  reaches a deep sparse row directly.
- No local API response, non-cancellation transport, or page error occurs.

- Grouped view loads with expanded group banners and its rows visible.
- Selecting the first field cell selects that cell.
- Shift-clicking a cell one row and one field away expands the selected range to
  a 2x2 area, addressed by visible row index across group banners rather than
  raw row position.

### 10.2.1 Shift+Arrow expands selected range

- Starting from one selected cell, Shift+ArrowRight expands the selected range
  to two cells.
- Shift+ArrowDown expands the selected range to a 2x2 area.

## Row Expand Modal

### 14.1.1 Open row expand modal from context menu

- Context menu opens for a row.
- Selecting "Enlarge row" opens the row edit modal.
- Modal contains the selected row value.
- Closing the modal hides it.

### 14.2.1 Modal edit that stops matching the filters

- Editing a modal-open row so it stops matching the filters keeps the row
  visible with a "Row does not match filters" warning.
- Row count is unchanged while the modal stays open.
- A follow-up edit in the modal does not hide any other row.
- Closing the modal hides the row that no longer matches.

### 14.2.2 Realtime updates into a non-matching modal row

- After a modal edit makes the row stop matching the filters, an update from
  another client is still reflected in the open modal.

## Public Shared Grid

### 15.1.1 Public grid renders rows without edit controls

- Public shared grid route renders without an authenticated session.
- Visible rows are loaded.
- Add row control is hidden.
- Row mutation context-menu actions are hidden.

## Row Ordering

### 19.1.1 Reorder a row inside a grouped leaf

- TODO:
    - With grouping active and no explicit sort, grouped rows expose drag handles.
    - Dropping a row at another visible slot in the same leaf group changes its
      position without changing its grouped field values.
    - Other leaf groups keep their row order and counts.

### 19.1.2 Move a row into another writable leaf group

- TODO:
    - Dropping a row at a visible slot in another leaf group immediately moves it
      to that slot.
    - Every active grouped field is updated to the destination group path before
      the row order is changed.
    - Source and destination group counts update immediately.
    - One undo restores both the original grouped values and original row
      position; one redo reapplies both changes.
    - If the value update succeeds but the move request fails, the row remains in
      the destination group with its original order.

### 19.1.3 Read-only grouping constrains row ordering to the current leaf

- TODO:
    - If any active group-by field is read-only, same-leaf insertion slots remain
      valid drag targets.
    - Insertion slots in every other leaf group are unavailable, including when
      the destination differs only in writable grouped fields.
    - Collapsed group headers and unloaded row placeholders are never drop
      targets.

## TODO Coverage

- 2.5.x: Editing source fields for visible formula fields that are not active
  filter/sort/group-by constraints; verify formula-cell loading, refresh, and
  rollback. Formula-backed filter/sort constraints are covered by 2.2.5 and
  2.3.4.
- 1.6.x: Create rows in a field with a unique / unique-with-empty constraint.
    - Adding a row whose value duplicates an existing non-empty value in a field
      with a unique constraint is rejected: the backend validation error is
      surfaced (error toast) and the optimistic row is rolled back.
    - With a unique-with-empty constraint, adding multiple rows that leave the
      field empty is accepted, while duplicate non-empty values are still
      rejected.
- 2.6.x: Edit rows in a field with a unique / unique-with-empty constraint.
    - Editing a cell to a value that duplicates another row's non-empty value in
      a field with a unique constraint is rejected: the backend validation error
      is surfaced and the typed value is rolled back to the previous value.
    - With a unique-with-empty constraint, clearing a cell is accepted even when
      other rows are already empty, while duplicate non-empty values are
      rejected.
- 4.2.x: Filter-affecting paste with formula-field filter (deferred warning path).
- 4.3.x: Sort-affecting paste with formula-field sort (deferred move path).
- 4.4.x: Backspace clears all selected cell values while an area selection is active.
- 4.5.x: Larger multi-cell paste matrix.
- 4.6.x: Copy selected cells with column headers via the context menu option.
- 4.7.x: Group-by-affecting paste backend-error rollback and formula group-by
  constraints. Regular keep-selected and deselect-before-confirmation are covered
  by 4.7.1a–4.7.1b.
- 5.3.x: OR filter combinations and filter groups.
- 7.x: Group-by standalone behavior not yet automated — each group renders its
  own add-row line and adding from a non-first group lands in that group; the
  add-row line keeps the small row height at medium/large row heights (covered
  by unit tests, not e2e); an empty grouped view keeps a top-level add-row line
  and a row created from it lands in its value-derived group, selected and with
  a filter warning when it does not match (covered by unit tests, not e2e);
  group banners draw a vertical cell
  separator at each field boundary in the scrollable-right section (covered by
  unit tests, not e2e); collapse/expand state persists across reload and is
  re-projected (kept on trailing-level add/remove, reset on reorder/replace);
  nested multi-level group-by collapse/expand, counts, and add-row;
  lazy-loading rows when scrolling deep into a large group (covered by unit
  tests, not e2e).
- 15.x: Ad-hoc grouping in the publicly shared grid — a visitor applying a
  different group-by rebuilds the group tree and loads rows for the new groups
  (covered by backend tests, not e2e).
- 7.x: Ad-hoc grouping for users who cannot update the view (e.g. read-only
  role) — the `group_by` parameter drives the group tree instead of the saved
  view group-bys (covered by backend tests, not e2e).
- 9.1.x: Row coloring from a formula-based decoration (section 9.1 covers
  single-select only).
- 9.4.x: Freeze columns drag UI and limits.
    - Freeze handle is visible when there is enough horizontal space.
    - Freezing 3 columns moves 3 columns into the frozen-left section.
    - Freezing 4 columns moves 4 columns into the frozen-left section.
    - The scrollable-right section scrolls independently.
    - The UI does not allow freezing more than 4 columns.
    - The UI does not allow freezing more columns than can fit in the available
      width.
- 9.7.x: Drag-and-drop fields.
    - Field-drag preview is visible while dragging a field header.
    - Target position is visible while dragging a field header.
    - Dropping reorders field headers.
    - Dropping reorders row cells to match the field headers.
    - Field order persists after reload.
- 12.2.x: Remaining single-row context menu actions beyond deletion, insert below,
  and duplicate (insert above, copy row URL).
- 13.2.x: Multi-row bulk actions on checkbox-selected rows.
- 14.2.x: Row expand modal deeper coverage — open via double-click, navigate
  prev/next rows, edit fields from inside the modal, filter re-check on modal
  close.
- 16.x: Realtime multi-user row events.
- 17.x: Realtime metadata and presence.
- 18.x: Data-sync read-only mode — add row button and delete row option are hidden
  when the table has a data sync without two-way sync enabled.
