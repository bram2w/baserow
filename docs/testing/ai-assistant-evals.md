# AI Assistant Evals

The assistant eval suite runs the real agent against a live LLM and scores the
outcome. Evals are defined in the codebase, synced automatically into
[Phoenix](../development/ai-assistant-tracing.md) as datasets, and every run is
recorded there as an experiment with per-case scores, cost, latency, and a full
trace. Why this platform: [ADR 007](../decisions/007-ai-assistant-eval-platform.md).

## Running evals from the UI

1. In `.env.docker-dev`: `COMPOSE_PROFILES=optional,ai,ai-evals`, plus a
   provider API key (e.g. `GROQ_API_KEY`) — see
   [AI assistant tracing](../development/ai-assistant-tracing.md) for the
   Phoenix side.
2. `just dc-dev up -d` — the `assistant-eval-runner` service migrates its own
   `baserow_evals` database, syncs the datasets into Phoenix, and serves
   `http://localhost:8090`.
3. Pick a whole dataset or individual cases, a model (pick **Custom…** to
   type any pydantic-ai model string), a repeat count, optional notes, and Run.
   The model list only offers models whose provider key is set — see
   [why a model is missing](ai-assistant-evals.md#why-a-model-is-missing-from-the-dropdown).
4. The run row shows live progress as `running 7/38`; click it to expand the
   run's log tail. Each queued or running row has its own **Stop**, and
   **Stop all** halts everything at once.
5. The run row links to the experiment in Phoenix when done.
6. The page's **Help** tab renders this guide and the
   [tracing guide](../development/ai-assistant-tracing.md) inline.

### Watching a run

The status cell counts finished case-repetitions against the total, which is
known before the first case starts. Clicking any row — running or finished —
expands the last 200 log lines captured from that run: one line per case with
its score and duration, plus any warnings and tracebacks. Only the worker
thread's lines are captured, so page requests never pollute a run's log.

The page polls every 2s while anything is queued or running and backs off to
30s once everything settles, repainting only the rows whose state actually
changed. A finished run's log is fetched once and then left alone.

The buffer is in memory and deliberately not persisted: a `.py` edit restarts
the runner, which rewrites in-flight runs to `failed` and drops their logs.
Raise or lower the captured level with `BASEROW_EVAL_RUNNER_LOG_LEVEL`
(default `INFO`). Only Baserow's own loguru output is captured — library
chatter (httpx, pydantic-ai retries) still goes to
`just dc-dev logs -f assistant-eval-runner`.

### Timeouts

Every case has a wall-clock budget — `BASEROW_EVAL_CASE_TIMEOUT`, default
120s. For scale: across the committed baseline's 111 runs the slowest case
takes 16.4s and the median 5.8s, so the budget only ever fires on a genuine
hang. Without it a single stuck case blocks the one worker indefinitely, and
the per-request timeouts don't bound it: `max_iters` requests times the
per-request timeout, plus retries, runs into several minutes.

A timed-out case is cancelled, not abandoned — `asyncio.wait_for` on the
agent's own event loop stops the in-flight provider call rather than leaving
a thread burning quota. It is recorded as a failed `completed_within_timeout`
check, so it scores 0 and counts in aggregates (a hang is a real failure, not
a skip), the run continues with the remaining cases, and the judge is not
asked to grade the empty answer.

**Stop** is cooperative and lands at the next case boundary, because the
worker sits inside a blocking LLM call that Python cannot interrupt. Queued
runs stop immediately; a running one finishes its current case first and ends
as `stopped`, keeping the cases it already logged to Phoenix — its status
reads `stopping…` in between. Stop one dataset from its row, or use **Stop
all** when an error is going to sink every remaining case anyway.

### Comparing a whole run

A selection spanning several datasets fans out to one experiment per dataset,
and the Results tab groups experiments by name. Leaving **Experiment name**
blank generates one shared `run-<timestamp>-<id>` name for the whole fan-out,
so the Results tab compares every dataset against the baseline in one view.
Type a name instead to group runs yourself — reusing a name across separate
submissions merges them into one group.

Experiments created before this grouping existed each carry their own
Phoenix-generated name, so they stay ungrouped.

### Recording why a run differed

Every experiment is stamped with its model, the resolved orchestrator
`model_settings` (temperature, reasoning effort, max tokens), the judge model,
prompt hashes, and git branch/commit — so a score is traceable to the
configuration that produced it without writing anything down. The **Notes**
field adds free text for whatever that does not cover; both the settings and
the note show under the model in the Results tab.

> **Warning:** the runner hot-reloads on any mounted `.py` change (including
> a lint/format pass), which kills queued and running experiments — don't
> edit backend Python while a run is in flight.

## Running evals from the CLI

The CLI uses your host env (`.env.local`): the database it points at and
`BASEROW_ASSISTANT_PHOENIX_URL` for Phoenix.

> **Warning:** CLI runs create real scenario data (users, workspaces, apps) in
> whatever database `DATABASE_NAME` points at, with no teardown. The runner
> service uses its own disposable `baserow_evals` database, so prefer it for
> bulk runs, or point `DATABASE_NAME` at a disposable database first.

```bash
# Sync the datasets defined in code into Phoenix (idempotent)
just b eval-sync

# Run a whole dataset
just b eval-run --dataset kuma-core

# Run selected cases (must all belong to the same dataset)
just b eval-run --case database/creates-simple-table --case database/creates-view-kanban

# Compare models / measure flakiness
just b eval-run --dataset kuma-builder --model groq:openai/gpt-oss-20b --runs 3 --name builder-20b
```

`--runs N` repeats every case N times in one experiment — the score spread
across repetitions is the flake signal. Compare experiments (models, prompt
changes, repeat runs) side by side in the Phoenix dataset view. Every
experiment is auto-stamped with its model, git branch and commit, and prompt
hashes, so branch/model comparisons are filterable in Phoenix.

## The datasets

| Dataset | Cases | Covers |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `kuma-core` | 3 | creating/listing databases and automations |
| `kuma-database` | 21 | tables, fields, views, filters, rows |
| `kuma-builder` | 16 | pages, elements, data sources, themes, user sources |
| `kuma-automation` | 7 | workflows, triggers, nodes |
| `kuma-docs` | 64 | docs Q&A via `search_user_docs`, incl. cannot-do guardrail cases |

`kuma-docs` needs the knowledge base: the `embeddings` service (`ai` profile)
plus a synced KB. When unavailable, those cases are recorded as skipped, not
failed.

## Writing a new eval

Cases live in
`enterprise/backend/src/baserow_enterprise/assistant/evals/datasets/` and are
picked up automatically (registration on import, synced at runner startup or
via `just b eval-sync`). A case is three parts — a scenario (the Baserow state
the agent starts from), a prompt, and checks:

```python
from baserow.test_utils.fixtures import Fixtures
from baserow_enterprise.assistant.evals.harness import tool_called
from baserow_enterprise.assistant.evals.registry import register_case, register_scenario
from baserow_enterprise.assistant.evals.scenarios import build_database_ui_context
from baserow_enterprise.assistant.evals.types import (
    CheckResult,
    EvalCase,
    EvalRunOutput,
    EvalScenario,
)


@register_scenario("database-my-scenario")
def _my_scenario(fx: Fixtures) -> EvalScenario:
    user = fx.create_user()
    workspace = fx.create_workspace(user=user)
    database = fx.create_database_application(workspace=workspace, name="Sales")
    return EvalScenario(
        user=user,
        workspace=workspace,
        ui_context=build_database_ui_context(user, workspace, database),
        refs={"database": database},
    )


def _my_checks(
    case: EvalCase, scenario: EvalScenario, output: EvalRunOutput
) -> list[CheckResult]:
    return [
        CheckResult("called list_tables", tool_called(output, "list_tables") >= 1),
        CheckResult(
            "answer mentions Sales",
            "sales" in output.answer.lower(),
            hint=output.answer[:200],
        ),
    ]


register_case(
    EvalCase(
        id="database/my-new-case",          # append-only, never rename
        dataset="kuma-database",
        prompt="Which tables are in the Sales database?",
        scenario="database-my-scenario",
        checks=_my_checks,
        max_iters=10,
    )
)
```

Rules that keep results comparable over time:

- **Case ids are append-only.** They are the stable key in Phoenix; renaming
  one breaks its history. Add new ids, never repurpose old ones.
- Scenario object names must match what the prompt references.
- Checks run right after the agent, with the scenario objects alive — DB
  assertions through `scenario.refs` are the norm. The harness automatically
  prepends a `tool_errors_within_budget` check (`EvalCase.max_tool_errors`,
  default 0).
- Pre-run state a check needs later (a snapshot before the agent acts) goes in
  `scenario.pre_state`.
- A case's score is `passed_checks / total_checks`; it passes only when every
  check passes.

## Contributing cases from the Phoenix UI

You don't need a PR to add a case: from the dataset editor, or from a trace
span's "Add Example to Dataset", add an example directly in Phoenix. `just b
eval-sync` preserves it — it no longer wipes examples that aren't in the
codebase, only code-owned ones (identified by a `case_id` in their metadata)
are replaced wholesale.

UI-added examples are **runnable**: they appear on the runner page under
"Added in the Phoenix UI" in their dataset's tab (reload the page after
adding one), and they run with the rest of the dataset too. The example's
`input` needs a `{"prompt": "..."}` (or `"question"`) and everything else is
optional metadata:

### Docs questions

Add the example to `kuma-docs`. It runs against the standard docs scenario
with the standard checks (`search_user_docs` called, at least one source),
and the LLM judge scores `answer_quality`. Optional fields:

- `output` → `{"reference_answer": "..."}` — the ideal answer the judge
  grades against.
- metadata `expected_keywords` — list of strings; adds an
  "answer mentions one of" check and informs the judge.

### Tool use cases

Add the example to the matching dataset (`kuma-database`, `kuma-builder`,
`kuma-automation`, `kuma-core`) and declare what to exercise in its metadata:

- `scenario` — name of a registered starting state (the
  `register_scenario("...")` ids in `evals/datasets/*.py` and
  `evals/scenarios.py`). Defaults to `empty-workspace`, a bare workspace —
  enough for "create a table called X"-style prompts. Pick a richer scenario
  when the prompt references existing objects; its object names must match
  what the prompt mentions.
- `expected_tools` — list of tool names; each adds a "called `<tool>`" check.
- `answer_contains` — list of strings; each adds a case-insensitive
  "answer contains" check.
- `mode` (agent mode, defaults to the dataset's usual one), `max_iters`,
  `max_tool_errors` — same meaning as on a code case.

Checks that assert on **database state** (rows really created, field types
correct) can't be expressed in metadata — promote the example to code for
those. The tool-error budget check always runs, and the full trace is linked
from every run, so even a check-less example is useful for experimenting.

To promote a UI-added example to code:

```bash
just b eval-export --dataset kuma-docs
```

This prints a ready-to-paste `_register_docs_case(...)` snippet per UI-added
`kuma-docs` example (question from the example, keywords/source patterns from
its metadata if the UI author set them, else `TODO` placeholders to fill in;
a `reference_answer` kwarg is included too if the example's `output` carries
one). Paste it into `datasets/docs.py`, pick a real id and keywords, then
`just b eval-sync` — the UI copy is dropped automatically because its prompt
now matches the code case (matched by exact prompt text, so no duplicate).
Non-`kuma-docs` datasets have no registration helper to generate from, so
`eval-export` prints a commented JSON block instead; write the scenario and
checks by hand.

### Reference answers for docs cases

A `kuma-docs` case can carry an ideal "reference answer" that the LLM judge
grades Kuma's answer against (see below). Add one in code with
`_register_docs_case(..., reference_answer="...")`, or curate it directly on
a synced example in the Phoenix UI by editing its `output` field to
`{"reference_answer": "..."}` — that's a normal, versioned edit to the
example, so it survives `just b eval-sync`: a code case with no
`reference_answer` never overwrites a live one, it only adopts it, and a
code-set `reference_answer` always wins over whatever is live.

## Models and providers

`EVAL_MODELS` in
`enterprise/backend/src/baserow_enterprise/assistant/evals/models.py` is the
candidate list — extend it there. Any pydantic-ai `provider:model` string
works via `--model`, or in the UI by picking **Custom…** and typing it. The
model applies to the whole agent, sub-agents included.

Per-model overrides live in `_MODEL_PROFILES` in
`enterprise/backend/src/baserow_enterprise/assistant/model_profiles.py`, keyed
by exact model name. The `gpt-5.6` family is pinned to
`openai_reasoning_effort="none"` there: it reasons by default, and OpenAI
rejects function tools alongside reasoning on `/v1/chat/completions`. That is
a workaround — the real fix is to resolve OpenAI models through the Responses
API, which is what pydantic-ai's own `openai:` prefix already defaults to.

### Why a model is missing from the dropdown

The dropdown is not `EVAL_MODELS` itself but `available_models()`, which keeps
only the entries whose `api_key_env` variable is set in the runner's
environment. A model with no key is silently absent rather than listed and
broken, so adding one to `EVAL_MODELS` is not enough to make it appear.

`docker-compose.dev.yml` forwards `GROQ_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`,
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, and `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to
`assistant-eval-runner` from `.env.docker-dev`. Set the variable the model's
entry names, then restart the service.

Gemini is the one asymmetric case: pydantic-ai authenticates with either
`GOOGLE_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY`, but `available_models()` only checks
`GOOGLE_API_KEY`. With only `GEMINI_API_KEY` set the Gemini entries stay
hidden even though a run would have worked — use `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, or reach
the model through **Custom…**, which skips the key check entirely and so
fails at request time instead of hiding.

## Prompts

Kuma's load-bearing prompts (the main system prompt and each sub-agent's
instructions — see `SYNCED_PROMPTS` in
`enterprise/backend/src/baserow_enterprise/assistant/evals/prompt_sync.py`)
are synced to Phoenix's **Prompts** tab as versioned prompts on every
eval-sync. Every experiment's `prompts` metadata records the content hash of
each prompt as it ran, so prompt-version comparisons are filterable in
Phoenix.

To experiment with a prompt change **without touching code** (Phoenix has no
plain edit box — editing goes through its playground):

1. Phoenix → **Prompts** → click **Open in playground** on the prompt's row.
   The playground loads its latest version as an editable System message.
2. Edit the text, then click the save-icon **Prompt** button in the prompt's
   header row, next to the name and version selectors. In the dialog the
   prompt name is pre-selected — optionally describe the change, then
   confirm. That appends a new version (append-only, nothing is lost; the
   "Run" playground button is irrelevant here).
3. On the runner page, expand **Prompt overrides** in the run panel and tick
   that prompt — checked prompts run with their latest Phoenix version
   instead of the code constant. CLI: `--override-prompt <name>`
   (repeatable). The list sorts the active tab's likely-relevant prompts
   first, but any prompt can be overridden — one the selected cases never
   exercise is just a no-op.
4. Run and compare: the experiment is stamped with the effective prompt
   hashes plus a `prompt_overrides` list naming what was overridden.
5. To promote a winning prompt, paste its text into the code constant — the
   next eval-sync records it as the new latest version. (Eval-sync also
   re-appends the code version as latest whenever the two drift, so an
   abandoned experiment resets itself on the next runner restart —
   overrides are opt-in per run, never sticky.)

Editing the constant in code directly still works too (the runner
hot-reloads .py changes).

## Reading results

Every experiment run links to its trace (agent → LLM calls → tool calls, with
token counts and cost). Failed checks appear in the experiment's `checklist`
evaluator explanation with their hints. How to compare against the committed
baseline, classify outcomes (improvement / regression / gap / flake), and
diagnose failures through traces:
[evaluating results](./ai-assistant-eval-analysis.md).

`kuma-docs` runs get a third score, `answer_quality`, from an LLM judge (the
judge prompt lives in `evals/judge.py`) that grades the answer's correctness,
helpfulness, and groundedness against the sources the assistant cited. When
the case (or its synced example) carries a `reference_answer`, the judge is
also given it and told to weigh factual agreement with it heavily — it's the
ideal answer, not the only acceptable phrasing, so wording differences alone
don't cost points. The judge model is `BASEROW_EVAL_JUDGE_MODEL`, defaulting
to `groq:openai/gpt-oss-120b`, and is stamped into every experiment's
metadata. A judge failure (LLM error, missing case, ...) records no
`answer_quality` score rather than a 0, so it doesn't skew aggregates.
