# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

Baserow is a monorepo. Core Django code lives in `backend/src`, shared backend tests in `backend/tests`, and the main Nuxt app in `web-frontend/` (`modules/`, `server/`, `test/`, `stories/`). Paid extensions mirror that layout in `premium/backend`, `premium/web-frontend`, `enterprise/backend`, and `enterprise/web-frontend`. End-to-end coverage lives in `e2e-tests/`. Product and contributor docs are in `docs/`, while deployment recipes are under `deploy/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use `just` from the repo root; it wraps the backend and frontend workflows consistently for local and Docker setups.

- `just init` installs dependencies and creates `.env.local`.
- `just dev up` starts the local stack; `just dc-dev up -d` runs the Docker dev environment.
- `just b test -n=auto` runs backend pytest suites in parallel.
- `just b test tests/baserow/core/notifications/utils.py` to test a specific file.
- `just f test` runs frontend Vitest suites.
- `just lint` runs both backend and frontend linters; `just fix` applies auto-fixes.
- `just b run pre-commit run --files $(git diff --name-only HEAD)` lints only the files you've touched on your branch (staged + unstaged); use `origin/develop...HEAD` instead of `HEAD` to scope to the whole branch. See `docs/development/code-quality.md` for details.
- `just b migrate` runs Django migrations.

For direct package-manager use, backend commands run through `uv` and frontend commands through `yarn`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Python targets Python 3.14, uses 4-space indentation, and is formatted and linted with Ruff (`just b lint`, `just b fix`) with an 88-character line length. Follow existing Django app/module naming and keep new tests in `test_*.py` or `*_test.py` files. Frontend code uses ESLint, Stylelint, and Prettier (`just f lint`, `just f fix`); SCSS should follow BEM-style naming already used in `web-frontend/modules`. Put frontend styles in a dedicated SCSS file and import it through the appropriate SCSS bundle; do not add `<style>` or `<style scoped>` blocks to Vue single-file components. Use `$palette-*` color variables in CSS; `$color-*` variables are legacy compatibility aliases and should not be used for new styles.

## Localization

When adding or changing UI copy, update the English locale files only. Do not add or edit non-English locale files such as `fr.json`, `es.json`, or `de.json` unless explicitly requested; those translations are managed through Weblate.

## Technology Stack

Backend code uses Django, Django REST Framework, Celery, PostgreSQL, Redis, and pytest/pytest-django. Python dependencies are managed with `uv`.

Frontend code uses Vue 3, Nuxt 4, Vuex, Vite, Vitest, Storybook, SCSS, ESLint, Stylelint, Prettier, and `yarn`. Render functions must use Vue 3 semantics, for example importing `h` from `vue` instead of expecting `render(h)` to receive it. JSX-bearing frontend files must use a `.jsx` or `.tsx` extension so Vite can parse them.

## Testing Guidelines

Backend tests use `pytest` with `pytest-django`; frontend tests use `vitest`; browser flows live in `e2e-tests/`. Add unit tests for backend changes and targeted frontend tests for component or store behavior.

Examples: `just b test tests/path/`, `just b test-coverage`, `just f test -- --coverage`, `just f yarn test:core path/to/test`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent history favors short, imperative subjects, often with Conventional Commit prefixes such as `fix:`, `feat:`, and `chore(deps):`. Branch from `develop`, keep PRs focused, and link the related issue or discussion. Include a clear summary, note schema or env changes, attach screenshots for UI work, add a changelog entry when required, and make sure the relevant lint and test commands pass before opening the PR.

## Project Skills

Reusable skills live in `.agents/skills/`. Each subdirectory is a self-contained skill with a `SKILL.md` that describes when and how to apply it. Use these instead of re-deriving the same workflow from scratch.

| Skill directory                   | When to use                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `add-config-env-var`              | Adding a backend or frontend configuration env var and propagating it through settings, Nuxt runtime config, Docker Compose, docs, consumers, and tests as needed  |
| `write-frontend-unit-test`        | Writing or fixing frontend unit tests in `web-frontend`, `premium/web-frontend`, or `enterprise/web-frontend`                                                        |
| `create-update-service`           | Creating or updating an integration type or service type in `contrib/integrations`                                                                                   |
| `create-in-app-notification`      | Creating or updating a Baserow in-app notification for an event, including backend and frontend registration, target routing data, and duplicate-prevention behavior |
| `add-update-builder-element-type` | Adding or updating an Application Builder element type across backend, frontend, migrations, registration, translations, icons, and targeted tests                   |
| `manage-backend-layers`           | Adding or changing backend model, handler, service, undoable action, and API view layers using the newer automation modules as the preferred pattern                 |

## Security & Configuration Tips

Do not commit secrets or local overrides. Use `.env.local` for development, keep production settings in the documented deploy configs, and report vulnerabilities privately via the contact path in `CONTRIBUTING.md` rather than opening a public issue.

## Good practices

- On a specific branch, always merge backend migrations file instead of creating new ones only if it was created on the very same branch.
- Django migrations must be executed with zero downtime. This means the new database schema must remain compatible with the previous application version during the deployment.
    - Every new field must define a `db_default`.
    - Do not remove fields unless you are certain they are no longer used by the previous application version. Instead, keep the field and add a `# TODO ZDM: remove this field in the next version` comment so it can be safely removed in a subsequent release.
- CSS classes respect BEM methodology.
- When working on translations, only update english unless told otherwise. Other languages are handled with Weblate. Don't nest keys too much, just keep one level of nesting.

## Memory

Before starting work, read `MEMORY.md` file at same level of `AGENTS.md` file if it exists for historical context and design decisions.
Update that memory file to keep track of the decisions.
